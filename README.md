## Introduction

"ShotZombie Adaptation: ShootBall" is a Java-based game that I developed during my freshman year to learn the Java programming language using Eclipse. Inspired by the popular game "ShotZombie," which my friends and I frequently played to compete for high scores, I decided to create a similar game with a sports twist.

### Gameplay

In this adaptation, you'll find yourself on a sports field instead of battling zombies. The objective is to shoot a variety of balls as they appear on the field. Here are the key features of the game:

- **Different Ball Types:** Shoot a range of balls based on the number of shots:
  - Golf Balls: Shoot 1-30 balls
  - Bowling Balls: Shoot 31-65 balls
  - Billiard Balls: Shoot 66-90 balls
  - Baseballs: Shoot 91-120 balls
  - Soccer Balls: Shoot 121-190 balls
  - Volleyballs: Shoot 191-235 balls
  - Basketball: Shoot 236+ balls
- **Scoreboard Challenge:** Progress through different ball types by shooting a specific number of balls.
- **Leaderboard:** Compete with friends and fellow players by achieving high scores and climbing the leaderboard.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys or ASD keys to aim and shoot the balls.
- Your challenge is to achieve the highest score possible within a 30-second time limit.
- The goal is to hit the required number of balls to advance to the next level and a new type of ball.
- Keep an eye on the scoreboard, and aim for the highest score to claim the top spot.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
